Sample project to test CppUTest for Keil MDK-ARM toolchain and AT91SAM7A3 chip.

Requirements:
1. CYGWIN (rm.exe, find.exe, mkdir.exe, make.exe)

2. Keil MDK-ARM

3. JLink Flash (for programming chip)

4. serial connection to DBGU interface

5. 4 MHz quartz. If else, need to be adjusted in src/ASM/SAM7A3.asm and
  src/Retarget.c (for _clock_init() function working correctly)

6. eclipse + gdb server from JLink + arm-none-eabi-gdb from GNU ARM Tools Embedded
  For debug only.

First, you need to compile CppUTest for target:
  make -C ../../../platforms/armcc all

Second, you need to write tests. As example, I take SimpleStringTest.cpp from
  tests directory of CppUTest home directory.

Third, you need to make executable:
  make all

Fourth, you need to program executable on target chip:
  make prog


All sources inside src/ directory and its subdirectories will be compiled, no
  way to add other sources or directories.

Project use semihosting, so you may use standard printf() or std::cout << "Hello!"
